**Dimerization of sub-nanoscale molecular clusters affords broadly tuneable viscoelasticity above the glass transition temperature**

Materials with desirable mechanical properties often require their key structural units—such as entanglements or crystalline grains—to exceed critical size thresholds. In this work, we demonstrate that viscoelasticity with broad tunability can be achieved solely via van der Waals interactions, even below these critical size limits. Specifically, we study dimers of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), which exhibit material behaviors fundamentally distinct from conventional POSS-based polymer nanocomposites.

Scattering and calorimetric analyses confirm that these dimeric POSS materials are intrinsically glassy, with glass transition temperatures (Tg) below room temperature.
Rheological measurements reveal that their viscoelastic properties can be finely tuned by simply modifying the chemical structure of the linkers connecting the POSS units. In the bulk state, each POSS cluster is spatially confined by neighboring dimers, and the dynamic coupling between the two linked clusters—governed by the length and flexibility of the linkers—plays a central role in their unique caging dynamics and macroscopic viscoelastic behavior.

**In this work, I used SISSO (a machine learning method for Symbolic Regression based on Compressed Sensing Algorithm) to predict a mathematical formula to confirm the strength of correlation with the rotational stiffness of the dimer linker and size of the dimer molecule.**

These findings advance the fundamental understanding of viscoelasticity at the molecular scale and open new opportunities for designing structural materials from sub-nanometer building blocks.
