summary: "We developed a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes pretrained language models to learn strategic poker play, earning the Best Poster Prize in CMU’s 10-623 Generative AI class."

Our project, "Fine-Tuning Pretrained Language Models for Poker Strategy Using Reinforcement Learning," was awarded the Best Poster Prize in Carnegie Mellon University's 10-623 Generative AI class. We explored the integration of transformer-based language models with reinforcement learning to tackle the challenges of imperfect-information games like poker.

Using Leduc Poker as our testbed, we fine-tuned pretrained models such as BERT on structured textual representations of game states. We then applied Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train our agents through self-play. Our approach demonstrated competitive performance in win rate, strategic diversity (e.g., bluffing), and training stability—showcasing the potential of language models in sequential decision-making tasks.
